## Jazal Unit Tests

This library's unit tests depend on framework pytest. In order to run a test
suite contained in this directory, type an instruction matching the following
template in command line.

```
pytest <file name>.py
```

Execute script run_all_tests.py to perform all the tests.

```
python run_all_tests.py
```

Since several tests use relative paths to an actual directory and an actual
file, run them from this directory to prevent exceptions.
