## Jazal Unit Tests

This library's unit tests depend on framework pytest. In order to run a test
suite contained in this directory, type in command line an instruction matching
the following template.

```
pytest <file name>.py
```

Execute script run_all_tests.py to perform all the tests.

```
python run_all_tests.py
```

Since several tests use relative paths to an actual directory and an actual
file, run them from the directory that contains the present file to prevent
exceptions.
